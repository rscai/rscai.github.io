<p>Mini book <strong>Migrating to Microservice Databases</strong> describes an approach to archive <strong>Zero Downtime</strong> deployment for Microservices Architectural application.</p>

<h2 id="service-deployment">Service Deployment</h2>

<p>Tranditional deployment arhcitectures have the clients issuing requests directly to server deployment.</p>

<pre><code class="language-puml">@startuml
actor client
node Host {
    [service]
}
database database

client -&gt; [service]
[service] -&gt; database
@enduml
</code></pre>

<p>It has to undeploy current version of application and then deploy new one to the running system. This will result in an undesirable amount of downtime.</p>

<p>To archive Zero Downtime deployment, we need to add another component. Instead of allowing users to directly connect to application services, we now have another process receiving the client’s requests and forwarding them to services. The new addition to the architecture is usually called a <strong>proxy</strong> or a <strong>load balancer</strong>. And the services must be redundant. So that when we shutted down them one by one for deploying new version, there are still active service instances to accept requests.</p>

<pre><code class="language-puml">@startuml
actor client
boundary proxy
node Host1 {
    [service1]
}
node Host2 {
    [service2]
}
database database

client -&gt; proxy
proxy ..&gt; [service1]
proxy ..&gt; [service2]
[service1] --&gt; database
[service2] --&gt; database
@enduml
</code></pre>

<p>Changes deployment is not one exit operation. It may end with rollback. Therefore a completed deployment plan must include rollback plan.</p>

<pre><code class="language-puml">@startuml
start
:shut down old version instance;
:deploy new version package;
:bring up new version instance;
:post implementation check;
if(PIT fail?) then (yes)
    :shut down new version instance;
    :rollback to old version package;
    :bring up old version instance;
    :PIT;
endif
end
@enduml
</code></pre>

<p>Take updating service from version <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v1</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v2</code> as example, firstly shut down instance <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">service1</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-puml">@startuml
actor client
boundary proxy
node Host1 {
    component [service1 v1] as service1 #LightGrey
}
node Host2 {
    component [service2 v1] as service2
}
database database

client -&gt; proxy
proxy ..&gt; [service1]#White
proxy ..&gt; [service2]
[service1] --&gt; database #White
[service2] --&gt; database
@enduml
</code></pre>

<p>Because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">service</code> instances are redudant. When instance <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">service1</code> is down, instance <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">service2</code> is still alive, therefore the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">service</code> is still available.</p>

<p>Then, deploy <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v2</code> package and bring up instance <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">service1</code>. Two versions of service are running at same time. Certain client request may be routed to certain version one. Well known, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v1</code> is compatible with client and database. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v2</code> must be compatible with client and database too. Shortly, the changes which introduced by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v2</code> must be backward-compatible.</p>

<pre><code class="language-puml">@startuml
actor client
boundary proxy
node Host1 {
    component [service1 v2] as service1
}
node Host2 {
    component [service2 v1] as service2
}
database database

client -&gt; proxy
proxy ..&gt; [service1]
proxy ..&gt; [service2]
[service1] --&gt; database
[service2] --&gt; database
@enduml
</code></pre>

<p>And then, do post-implementation-check. If everything is working as expected, then apply update on other instances gradually. In our case, it should apply update on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">service2</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-puml">@startuml
actor client
boundary proxy
node Host1 {
    component [service1 v2] as service1
}
node Host2 {
    component [service2 v2] as service2
}
database database

client -&gt; proxy
proxy ..&gt; [service1]
proxy ..&gt; [service2]
[service1] --&gt; database
[service2] --&gt; database
@enduml
</code></pre>

<p>If changes on instance <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">service1</code> does not match expected, it has to rollback <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">service1</code> from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v2</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v1</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-puml">@startuml
actor client
boundary proxy
node Host1 {
    component [service1 v1] as service1
}
node Host2 {
    component [service2 v1] as service2
}
database database

client -&gt; proxy
proxy ..&gt; [service1]
proxy ..&gt; [service2]
[service1] --&gt; database
[service2] --&gt; database

<h3 id="backward-compatible-service-change">Backward-Compatible Service Change</h3>

<p>To archive Zero Downtime deployment, the changes of service must be backward-compatible. Service cooperate with others through API contract. In our example, service cooperate with client through RESTful API contract, with database through JDBC and schema contract.</p>

<h4 id="backward-compatible-restful-api-change">Backward-Compatible RESTFul API Change</h4>

<p>RESTFul API is resource-centric. The key components of RESTFul API contract are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Resource
    <ul>
      <li>name</li>
      <li>property
        <ul>
          <li>name</li>
          <li>type</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Method</li>
</ul>

<p>All potential changes:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Component</th>
      <th>Add</th>
      <th>Change</th>
      <th>Remove</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Resource name</td>
      <td>Y</td>
      <td>Y</td>
      <td>Y</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Property name</td>
      <td>Y</td>
      <td>Y</td>
      <td>Y</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Property type</td>
      <td>Y</td>
      <td>Y</td>
      <td>Y</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Method</td>
      <td>A</td>
      <td> </td>
      <td>Y</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h5 id="add-resource-name">Add Resource Name</h5>

<p>In RESTFul API, it identifys resource name by URL, and each resource has itself URL endpoint. Therefore adding a new resource would not cause any backward-compatible issue.</p>

<h5 id="change-resource-name">Change Resource Name</h5>

<p>Changing resource name is implemented as changing URL endpoint. Changing URL ednpoint will break consumer components. it should take create-migration-destroy process. Firstly expose new resource with new name; then migrate all consumer component to new resource endpoint; finally destroy old resource endpoint.</p>

<pre><code class="language-puml">@startuml

component [service]
interface "/oldResourceName" as old
interface "/newResourceName" as new
old -- [service]
[service] -- new
client -&gt; old

<pre><code class="language-puml">@startuml

<h2 id="database-schema-deployment">Database Schema Deployment</h2>

<p>To archive Zero Downtime deployment, services are updated gradually. It means that two versions of serivce are accessing database simultaneously.</p>

<p>TBD</p>

<p>Code changes and database(schema) changes must be decoupled, so that they could be released and rolled back independnetly.</p>

<p>For example, assume the version of code and database are 1.0 and 1.0 respectively. Now we want to make cahnges which involve code and schema changes. It should release schema changes in database release 1.1 firstly, then release code changes in code release 1.1.</p>

<p>With decoupling code changes and schema changes, it’s able to minimize the changes batch size, and reduce down time.</p>

<pre><code class="language-puml">@startuml

<h2 id="mutually-compatible-schema-change">Mutually Compatible Schema Change</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Schema versions between consecutive releases must be mutually compatible. It also means that we can’t create database migrations that are destructive. Destructive here means that we can’t afford to lose any data, so we can’t issue any steatement that can potentially cuase the loss of data.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="add-a-column-migration">Add a Column Migration</h3>

<p>Adding a column should follow steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add column in schema, the new column must be NULLABLE</li>
  <li>release code which populates the new column</li>
  <li>set new column to NOT NULL if business logic required</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="rename-a-column-migration">Rename a column Migration</h3>

<h3 id="drop-table">Drop Table</h3>

<p>Dropping table is destroyed. It must remove reference from code, then drop table from database. Supposed that we want to drop table in database 1.3, it must remove all reference from code in code release 1.2. Then when we dropped table in database, it would not break anything.</p>
